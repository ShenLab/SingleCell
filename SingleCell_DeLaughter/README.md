# Scripts for Single Cell data processing:


# Mouse reference genome was obtained from the following link: 
http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gtf/mus_musculus/



# experiments.xlsx includes updates on sample information



# library_builder.R build the transcripts to genes library for next step



# t2gene.R merges transcripts into genes, generates TPMs and Est. counts for each gene



# high_var_gene_filter.R using both linear regression and sigmoid fit to select highly varible genes 



# mds_plots does multidimensional scaling on normalized dataset, and plot with perfect genes markers for each cell type



# total_raeds_counts.py counts total number of reads for each cell
